# Refactoring Golf
![illustration code golf]( ./code_golf.png "it's you 😅")


## Instructions

npm install -g npm@latest

nvm install node

### install yarn

https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

### then, run yarn to install all dependencies

yarn needs to read the package.json file to know the dependencies and the scripts definitions

**THE FOLOWING COMMAND LINES must be typed in a terminal, at the folder PATH where there is the 'package.json' file**

```sh
yarn install --ignore-engines
```

### Execute tests

Just run the test suite

```sh
yarn test
```

#### Run the test suit with code coverage

```sh
yarn test:ci
```

## on branch 'ExoNN' , tests must be green

```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       10 passed, 10 total
Snapshots:   0 total

```

# Exercise for Students

 - Fork the project on your GitHub account OR join the Github classroom
   - if you fork: UNcheck the option `Copy the main branch only` 
 - Clone the project on your local machine
   - if you forked the project , copy each branch for each exercise, prefix with your name or group name , like 'ICE-GRP1/Exo01'  from /Exo01
   - if you joined the Github classroom, just switch to the branch 'Exo01'
 - open the file `src/12_RefactoringGolf/exo1/kata.ts`
 -  fix indentation first -> to produce a change, on which you can comment/start a review
   - use Prettier to fix the indentation (see below)
 - commit and push that change
 - goto the github page of the project, and create a Pull Request on the branch 'Exo01'
 - click on 'Contribute' button, then click on 'Open a pull request'
 -  make your comments, using :
     1. your brain -> spot only the problem described on this exercise
     2. your AI ->  you must only answer the question of this exercise (EXO 01)
 - Write a review !!!!   IMPORTANT ! a score (grade) will be given for this step
 - Refactor the code to fix the problem(s), ONLY WHERE YOU PLACE A COMMENT/REVIEW !!!!!
   - ***code modified by AI that does not respond to the review will be rejected*** 
 - Ensure the tests are still green
 - Commit and push your changes

## Prettier

To install Prettier, you can use npm or yarn. Here are the commands for both:

Using npm:

```sh
npm install --save-dev prettier
```
Using yarn:

```sh
yarn add --dev prettier
```

After installation, you can format your code using Prettier by running:

```sh
npx prettier --write .
```

This will format all files in your project. You can also create a .prettierrc file to customize Prettier's configuration.


## on your Forked Project

- put your names in README ETUDIANTS.md; commit and push.
- Create a Pull Request on Exo01
    - Use a diff tool to see the differences in code between the starting hole and end hole
    - write your annotations, remarks... spot the problem(s)
    - make a refactoring to the code, to fix the problem
    - be sure the tests are green
    - review your changes
    - push (but don't merge) the pull request to the original repository

- Move to Exo 2 and do the same to refactor the code from Exo 2 to be like the code in Exo 3
- Apply the same pattern until you reach Exo 8
- Remember to keep the code compiling and the tests passing at all times during the refactor
- For every refactor, run the tests, and if they pass, commit
- It's okay, and actually heavily encouraged, to revert back to a previous working state at any moment


## Before you start

- Make sure the code builds, and tests are passing `yarn test`

## First run

- Refactor the code as best as you can.
    - Create your own branch based on 'Exo001', for example: 'Exo001-review'
        - Create a pull request
        - annotate your ideas, remarks on code
        - do the refactoring
        - create a Pull Request

## other runs

- Refactor the code following the treatment available for each code smell in <https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells>.


## Refactoring Priority Premise

### The kata uses the following order of code smells to refactor

- Refactor readability
    - Comments
    - Dead code
    - Magic strings and numbers
    - Scope (variables, blocks)
    - Clutter
    - Implicit knowledge
    - Naming
- Reduce complexity
    - Duplicated code
    - Long method
- Reorder responsibilities
    - Data class
    - Message chain
    - Feature Envy
    - Inappropriate Intimacy
    - Large class
- Refine abstractions
    - Long parameter list
    - Data clump
    - Primitive obsession
    - Middle man
- Refactor to design patterns
    - Switch statements
    - Strategy
    - State
    - Command
    - others
- Refactor to SOLID
    - Refused bequest
    - Divergent change
    - Shotgun surgery
    - Speculative generality
    - Parallel inheritance


## Additional Instructions

#### Execute mutation tests

```sh
yarn mutants
```

#### Run the tests in watch mode

```sh
yarn watch
```
